== Description ==
Automated testing of WordPress involves running test cases where manual intervention is not required to run each one.

* WordPress is a complicated system. 
* There aren't as many tests as you might have hoped.
* But the team are working on it.  
* Each new TRAC could/should be backed up by a new test.
 
The purpose of this plugin is twofold:

1. To allow the WP-a2z dynamic API reference parser to be run against the PHPUnit tests for WordPress. Developers can then view the tests and navigate through them as if they were a real plugin.
2. To provide the framework functionality for in situ PHPUnit testing of plugins and themes using oik-batch.

== Installation ==

* Only intended for installation into a WordPress environment where you'll be running your own PHPUnit tests.
* The zip file is built from the tests folder of the wordpress-develop SVN repository.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =
Nothing as a plugin. 
You have to invoke the tests using PHPUnit.

From v4.9.1 we provide a modified version of the phpunit.xml file so that you can attempt to run the WordPress core tests in situ.
- We'll be running the tests in a Windows 10 environment using PHP 7.4 and maybe PHP 7.3.
- The configuration file is different from the one delivered in WordPress core.
- Note: The tests do not run to completion. That is, they don't actually work when run in situ.

Testsuites
The primary directory is different. You run the tests from the plugin directory, 
Instead of being called tests/phpunit/tests the directory is phpunit/tests

We expect PHP 7.2 - 7.4 so there's no need for the exclude sections

    <testsuites>
        <!-- Default test suite to run all tests -->
        <testsuite>
            <directory suffix=".php">tests/phpunit/tests</directory>
            <exclude>tests/phpunit/tests/actions/closures.php</exclude>
            <exclude>tests/phpunit/tests/image/editor.php</exclude>
            <exclude>tests/phpunit/tests/image/editorGd.php</exclude>
            <exclude>tests/phpunit/tests/image/editorImagick.php</exclude>
            <exclude>tests/phpunit/tests/oembed/headers.php</exclude>
            <file phpVersion="5.3.0">tests/phpunit/tests/actions/closures.php</file>
            <file phpVersion="5.3.0">tests/phpunit/tests/image/editor.php</file>
            <file phpVersion="5.3.0">tests/phpunit/tests/image/editorGd.php</file>
            <file phpVersion="5.3.0">tests/phpunit/tests/image/editorImagick.php</file>
            <file phpVersion="5.3.0">tests/phpunit/tests/oembed/headers.php</file>
        </testsuite>

Groups - the exclusion list is the same.

    <groups>
        <exclude>
            <group>ajax</group>
            <group>ms-files</group>
            <group>ms-required</group>
            <group>external-http</group>
        </exclude>
    </groups>


Logging - There's no logging section.

    <logging>
        <log type="junit" target="tests/phpunit/build/logs/junit.xml" logIncompleteSkipped="false"/>
    </logging>

We control it from the command line.


Listeners - There's no listener section

	<listeners>
		<listener class="SpeedTrapListener" file="tests/phpunit/includes/speed-trap-listener.php">
			<arguments>
				<array>
					<element key="slowThreshold">
						<integer>150</integer>
					</element>
				</array>
			</arguments>
		</listener>
	</listeners>
	
Filter - There's no filter section - since we don't do code coverage
	
	<filter>
		<whitelist processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true">
			<directory suffix=".php">src</directory>
		</whitelist>
	</filter>
	
PHP const - same as for core
    <php>
        <const name="WP_RUN_CORE_TESTS" value="1" />
    </php>



= What would happen if I did actually run this? =
If you activate the plugin then nothing is expected to happen since it doesn't contain any code. 


If you run PHPUnit then quite a lot might happen.
 
And if you had happened to configure your database the same as your live site then you could destroy your live site.
But probably not completely! 


= Can I run the tests from my WordPress site? =
I'm sure you could try to do this but I can't see why you'd want to.

= How do I run in situ tests for my plugin or theme =

Use this plugin in combination with [oik-batch](https://github.com/bobbingwide/oik-batch) 

= What versions of PHPUnit does this support? =

From WordPress 5.2.3 and above the only version supported is PHPUnit 8.


= How does this help me to develop WordPress tests? =

In the same way that WP-a2z.org helps you to develop WordPress code
this provides you with a dynamic reference of current tests.
See [develop.wp-a2z.org](https://develop.wp-a2z.org)


= Have you actually tried using this? =

Yes. oik-plugins are PHPUnit tested using in situ testing. 
See [How to run PHPUnit tests for WordPress plugins in situ](https://herbmiller.me/2016/08/21/run-phpunit-tests-wordpress-plugins-situ/)


= What's the process for managing this repo? =

Original method: Nov 2014

To get WP-A2z to work locally I simply created a symbolic link
from the latest SVN version to a plugin directory.

cd wp-content/plugins
mklink /J wordpress-develop-tests svn\wordpress-develop\tests
